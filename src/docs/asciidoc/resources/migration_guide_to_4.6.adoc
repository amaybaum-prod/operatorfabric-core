= Migration Guide from release 4.5.X to release 4.6.0

== Deprecated `toNotify` field

The card field `toNotify` is deprecated. You should use the `actions` field including "STORE_ONLY_IN_ARCHIVES" action instead.

== New line added between opfab fields and template in usercard form

A new line (<br/>) has been added in the usercard form, between the opfab fields (service/process/state or severity or
dates fields (depending on which fields are visible or not)) and the display of the template. So you have to check that
the display of your usercard form still suits you.
